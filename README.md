## 🐞 Vulnerabilities

> Discovery and analysis of vulnerabilities in open-source projects (blockchain, telecom, parsers, etc.).  
> These findings were reported via FuzzingLabs and are referenced in the archived *“Fuzzing Trophies”* page.

- **Juno** — [Issue #439](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/issues/439)  
- **Parsip** — [Issue #7](https://github.com/kamarkiewicz/parsip/issues/7)  
- **rust-pfcp** — [Issue #1](https://github.com/workerwork/rust-pfcp/issues/1), [Issue #2](https://github.com/workerwork/rust-pfcp/issues/2)  
- **gtp-rs** — [Issue #1](https://github.com/ErvinsK/gtp-rs/issues/1)  
- **Archived page:** [Wayback Snapshot — FuzzingLabs “Trophies”](https://web.archive.org/web/20240221095936/https://fuzzinglabs.com/fuzzing-vulnerabilities-trophies/)

📝 *Note: These vulnerabilities were discovered during my cybersecurity apprenticeship at FuzzingLabs.  
The disclosures were published by the organization, but I provide the public issues and archived pages here as verifiable evidence of contribution.*
